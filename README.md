# Broadcast Pointing

Just a silly demo using the [Broadcast Channel API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API) to have all these pages point at each other's windows or send each other emojis.

Open multiple windows (not tabs!) of the [BroadcastPointing page](https://david-risney.github.io/BroadcastPointing/).
